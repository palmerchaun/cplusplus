//How are random number useful?
//How are random numbers generated?
//Is there actually such a thing as random numbers on computers?

//1. 
//Generate pseduo-random numbers

//Do your numbers match my numbers?
//What does this tell you?

//Comment out the above section and run the next section

    cout << arr[i] << endl;

cout << time(NULL) << endl;


//seed it with the clock and run twice

}

//1. Create int max random numbers from 1 - 100 (use modulus)
//2. Save the number of occurrences of each number in an int array. 
//3. Output the percentage of occurrences of each random number. 
//4. Try it with the seeds presented above and see how the results differ.
